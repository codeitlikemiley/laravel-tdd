# Laravel TDD Snippets

All of the Snippets Here are All Compiled From Either the Documentation of laravel or Inside the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing` Which Ive Extracted Piece by Piece Some Of the Methods and Encapsulated it Here As Snippets. All the Prefixes Can be listed using tdd- then the type of traits/class found on test case.

## List of All TDD prefixes for listing other prefixes

```
ttd-api
ttd-auth
ttd-console
ttd-db
ttd-exception
ttd-requests
ttd-responses
ttd-session
pu-array
pu-basic
pu-class-object
pu-files
pu-fixture
pu-object
pu-string
pu-upload
pu-xml-html
```

# List of all Custom TDD methods

```
tdd:met
tdd:_met
tdd:true
tdd:equals
tdd:passport
tdd:factory-merge
```

## Usage Example

1. To list all tdd prefixes for api type `tdd-api` Then Press Enter

   Note: `for custom tdd method you need to use` **_tdd:_** but dont press enter since They Will be auto populated by vscode.

2. A list of Prefixes will be Dropdown for you to Select With.
3. Use Arrow Key To Select A Prefix then Enter

   Note:
   `Due to the limitation of Vscode Snippets , After Selecting The Prefix , You need to press backspace (deleting the last character) then re-entering the last character will show you the auto completion for that specific snippet`

**Enjoy!**
